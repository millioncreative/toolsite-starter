Welcome to the minimal bilingual toolsite! This starter packs a static Astro build, flexible content collections, and a lightweight design system.

## What you get

- A localized layout with navigation and language switching.
- Content collections that keep articles organized by locale.
- Room to grow with tool listings and blog posts.

## Next steps

Add your own utilities under the `/tools` route, write documentation in the `/blog` collection, and adapt the dictionaries for your tone of voice.

Happy building!
