## Define goals and metrics

Start by aligning the team on the release goal and how success will be measured.

## Sync design and prototypes

Confirm that critical journeys are reviewed and captured in the latest design files.

## Prepare implementation

Document API dependencies, rollout steps, and rollback plans to handle surprises.

## Ready launch assets

Draft emails, in-product messaging, and social assets so every channel speaks consistently.

## Follow up and learn

Review data and feedback quickly after launch and schedule a retro to capture learnings.
