## Set a review cadence

Pair design critiques with engineering planning so updates stay coordinated.

## Share one task board

Track design, engineering, and data follow-ups in a single board with clear owners.

## Deliver with rich context

Ship annotated, high-fidelity handoffs that cover interaction states and reduce back-and-forth.

## Align acceptance criteria

Agree on launch readiness checkpoints ahead of time to avoid last-minute surprises.

## Keep checking in

Invite feedback from frontline teammates post-launch and iterate on the details quickly.
